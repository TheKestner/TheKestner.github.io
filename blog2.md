## Week 2  

* **What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?**

    I try to not get ahead of myself but it would be great to be able to build from scratch without feeling the need to relay heavily on learning material. I know that is something that I will get the hang of with time and part of the learning experience. 

* **What are you struggling with?**

    Github was more of a struggle than the Html structure that we learned this week. Although some aspects of the CSS I am still unfamiliar with but it is starting to come together. I believe my biggest struggle will be next week once we actually dive deeper into Javascript but looking forward to tackling it deeper than what grasshopper shows you.

* **How do you solve a problem?**

    Trial and Error is how I attempt to resolve most problems. Such as the issue I experienced with code that was working in Gitpod but not in GitHub. Running through it again and attmepting changes based on review of resources lead me to resolving the issue. Which I believe in the future that Devtool will be a very helpful thing to use and to try quick changes to attempt to resolve issues as well.

* **What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?**

    Aside from the Trial and Error option that I mention previously. Talking myself through it again to see if there is anything I missed or anything that clicks from the resources that didn't previously. Kinda similar to the Rubber Ducky Method that the training references as well.
