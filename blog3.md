## Week 3  

* **What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing a user experience?**
It was really interesting to discover the different roles that HTML, CSS and JavaScript play in creating content for users. It's cool to have all these different things independently of each other, but also to serve its purpose. It's similar to like HTML being a Canvas for these other roles to add more Style or Functionality as needed. These layers of abstraction allow for more depth for the user experience on a website. I look forward to learning even more about these roles and any other roles as I progress along this coding journey!
